Things that went well
-	We planned out the sprint well, populated the backlog well
-	We were better about marking things as active
-	We actually put in tests
-	A lot better about continuous integration/ working with smaller chunks, everyone committing often
-	Communicated more/ were a lot better about merging pull requests 
-	Had a relatively consistent velocity

Things that didn’t go well
-	Need to comment the code more
-	Need to be more critical of other people’s code
-	Need to follow TDD/ and a lot better coverage
-	Need to meet up more
-	Separate components more
-	Put way too much until the last minute (could have gotten more done throughout)
