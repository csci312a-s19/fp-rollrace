Notes for Retrospective

Things that went well:
- Most of sprint backlog is empty
- Built off of old strengths (brought each persons experience to the table)
- planning tasks was done well
- interacting with the backlog 
(checking item out, and working on it)


Things that did not go well:

- More TDD, write the TESTS.
- Not enough rolling
- Did more rebasing than we should haves
- Not enough pull requests, so people were too many commits
ahead
- Breaking down backlog into more bite size chunks
- Commit more often to maintain a history (does not imply
a pull request)
- comment code (explain to someone else)
- communicate more!
